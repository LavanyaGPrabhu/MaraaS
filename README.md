# The MaraaS Map – A Cloud-Based Campus Crowd Monitoring System
###### "Marauders-as-a-Service"

##### The MaraaS Map is a cloud-powered application designed to provide real-time visualization of crowd density across various campus locations such as canteens, libraries, and classrooms. Inspired by the Marauder’s Map, this system enables students to check in manually, contributing to a live heatmap that helps them avoid congestion and optimize their time. The application integrates simulated data and cloud services for data storage, authentication, real-time updates, and dynamic crowd analysis.

### Problem Statement:
##### Large campuses often experience overcrowding during peak hours, with no transparent system to assist students in navigating busy areas. This project addresses the need for an interactive, real-time crowd monitoring tool to improve campus navigation and resource utilization.
# 
### Demo Plan:
* Simulated and real-time check-in data.
* 3–5 campus zones displayed.
* Live heatmap visualization.
* Optional gamification features.
